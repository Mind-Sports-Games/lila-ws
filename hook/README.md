# Steps for pre-commit git hook to check for compile and format

1) This repository uses [scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/). Please ensure it is installed.

2) You need to give execution permission to the pre-commit-hook-install script:
> `chmod +x pre-commit-hook-install.sh`

3) run the install script this will create two files in `.git/hooks`
> `./pre-commit-hook-install.sh`

4) give permissions to execute these two new files:
> `chmod +x pre-commit`
> `chmod +x pre-commit-hook.sh`

5) You are all set up and good to go. Ff the commit fails due to formatting make sure you run `sbt scalafmt`!

If there are changes to the pre-commit script you will need to run the install again
